# Phase 5, Modified CV information and moving agents in the web

# Update CV Inforamtion
- For Swiss Post I already completed work there, and all project are completed, you can update the information.
- The one active now is from Varkey Education with Education Project

# Moving Agents
- For this I vibe a sample source for moving that I think its good, you can get it here C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Web Moving Anime, and check document.md file for document of that source.
- Check the source, and follow this to do modification:
1. In portforlio page, I want to add this animation moving using the same image from the sample source, and when user hover on it, it stop and ask "you need help?, click me, otherwise let me chill!". When user click it, another agent chat will show at the position of it, its the Meg Agent and its like moving for better healthy, also it will has my experience data and some funtions (update later), for now user can ask about my experience and when user ask if it can do other thing, the response is my boss is updating.... And when user close the chat, it appear again and start moving around the page.
2. Its will count the time user hover to it make it stop moving, then it will say thing like "Again, what you need help??", and after 5 times, it will get really aggressive. The message show when hover it will be from the agent itself, not a hard code text.
