# thing need you check when I checked for phase 5

Round 1:
1. please update the meg's walking agent of that sprite animation to Min, and with these changes:
Min is an agent that walk around the page (animation), and had information about me (Meg and my experience), and some form fill function but its will be updated later. So when user click on Min is like interupt her walking and open the chat, user can ask Min about me and my experience, Min will not understand other technical problem and can't give user about suggestion, solution for anything related to technical. When user ask Min about what she can other than answer question and walk, she will response that she had Form function but its not available now, here boss will update. When user ask should if she want to walk again, mostlikely she will want that and user ok, the chat close and the sprite (her) start walking again. Also something if the Min chat still open, maybe after 1 mins without any user question, Min will ask user to let her walk again if they don't have any question or want any help, then user ok then the chat close and she walk. The chat conversation should keep, so when user click her again to continue conversation, and sure that she will have that aggressive vibe because of being disturb many time while walking.
2. The message when user hover to the animation sprite, need to increase the pop up message width because current can see the full message but it the height, so its not easy to read.

Round 2:
1. Check this conversation:
wait you're not Min?
I’m the AI assistant you’re chatting with. “Min” is just a character/persona in this app (the one who was “walking”). I can speak as Min when the app does, but I’m not a real person—just the assistant behind the chat.

If you prefer, I can:

keep talking as Min, or
drop the persona and talk neutrally as an assistant.
Which do you want?

-> The walking and the chat is one, its Min, so actually when user click on Min, the chat show is to chat to her, please check the 1. from round 1 again.

Round 3:
I think the policy not allow because the 5.2 is using for copilotkit
1. Please update the message when user hover to Min, she will say positive about walking make your health better and greeting thing. But its should not be a hard text, its should like Min agent think about the message and then it show the message
2. Also update anything that have the negative vibe for Min agent.
